# FaceMaskDectionAlertSystem

Face mask detection alert system can that can detect a person in real-time if he/she is wearing a mask or not using CCTV camera with quite a good accuracy. After that, he/she is denied access to places where authorities have strictly asked to wear the face mask. After denying access to the person, authorities will get an alert email in real-time where the personâ€™s photo will be attached. May be screen panels could be installed at the entrances where a person when denied can see a pop-up Warning Message where he/she would be advised to wear a 
mask before getting access. This kind of Face Mask Detection Alert System has applications at Airports, Hotels, Public Buildings like Driving Licence Offices, and other major places where we expect large public gatherings. We will be using Python, OpenCV, Keras with Tensorflow as a backend for building the Deep Learning Convolution Neural Network model in this project series. This project is very useful to check Covid-19 spread.

With further improvements these types of models could be integrated with CCTV or other types cameras to detect and identify people without masks. With the prevailing worldwide situation due to COVID-19 pandemic, these types of systems would be very supportive for many kind of institutions around the world. Please let me know your ideas, suggestions and concerns in the comment section and feel free to improve this project yourself and come up with better results
